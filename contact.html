        <p>One of my primary interests is leveraging technology to help humans make better decisions. I believe human cognition can be significantly enhanced by providing relevant data that has been tailored for that person's cultural and educational background, maximizing human potential worldwide. One specific instance of this interaction between humans and data is in the realm of fairness. It seems evident that some decisions are more fair than others, but defining precisely what is fair and how to move in this space is a non-trivial problem. Fairness is important because when humans participate in fair systems they continue to cooperate even when a decision is contrary to their personal desire. When participants of systems believe the system in which they're a part of is not fair, human cooperation decreases, often to the point of non-participation or violence, which is typically counterproductive to the goals of most people in that system. Computer science domains that are relevant for these goals are artificial intelligence and machine learning, natural language processing, and access to large-scale data while simultaneously being aware of privacy concerns for participants. .</p>
