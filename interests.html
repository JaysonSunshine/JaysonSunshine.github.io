        <p>I am interested in solving complex problems using mathematical and computational modeling. Problem domains Iâ€™m interested in include biological, economic and political systems. One of my long-term goals is to leverage existing access to information across a range of cultures to construct a fairness system that would allow users to search for fair or correct behavior/decisions in various situations. The knowledge would be generated by searching, sorting, and categorizing events, stories, religions, etc., and would have similar confidence levels as users currently expect while searching for general information using contemporary search engines. The goal would be to present results in an easy to digest form, perhaps similar to Wolfram Alpha, that could list ethical behavior by various cultural or philosophical systems as well as whether there is widespread consensus or whether it is considered an unsolved ethical problem. Additional information might be listing of prerequisite knowledge to understand or appreciate the various solutions given. Finally, there might be semantic translation that might give optimal ethical solutions given other constraints, such as age, intelligence, and/or education of the actor. Technologies necessary to implement the above would include significant natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning/data mining..</p>
