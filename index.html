     <h3>Fairness</h3>
        <p>It's been said life is unfair. I believe this does not represent an accurate, if stoic, assessment of the nature of human life, but rather a surrendering to an overwhelming challenge.<br><br>What are the sources of unfairness?<br>
        <ul>
	       <li>Limitations on human power in the universe: e.g.sometimes people acquire infectious disease for no other reason than there's an abundance of competing lifeforms on our planet all struggling for a fixed amount of biological resources.</li>
           <li>Our own minds: humans, through variations in their biology and culture, inflict significant harm on themselves through their own perceptions of existence and their role in it</li>
	       <li>Inequalities in human constructed systems: the direct increase of the suffering of some to insufficiently increase the well-being of others</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>This final point is a major source of preventable suffering in the lives of humans. <i>It doesn't have to exist</i>. It's less than it was in the past, and hopefully it will be less in the future. It will be less in the future because people living right now create that world. Let's be those people.
        <br><br>
        I want to help build tools to ensure all beings receive the fairness they deserve, by assisting human political, economic, and cultural in leaders making the right decisions.
        <br><br>
        I am interested in combining computing technology and statistical reasoning to solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">problems</a> that exceed the capacity of the unassisted human brain.
        <br><br>
        I am inspired by Elon Musk to try to tackle problems that are believed unsolvable by many people. One of my goals is to develop an interactive system-knowledge base that would synthesize ideas across cultures and idea systems to help humans decide which behaviors are fair across a range of human interactions. The system could help politicians develop reponses to other nations, influence domestic policy, connect people who are being mistreated to resources both in their area and at the national or international levels (for certain types of abuses, such as police or military misconduct), and help people navigate their personal relationships.</p>
