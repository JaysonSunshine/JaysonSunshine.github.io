The Basics: Dealing with Files
	Environment variables
	– $PATH – List of directories to search for commands
	– $HOME – Home directory
	– printenv: prints all env variables
	– echo $PATH
	echo $HOME
	mv: move a file (no undos!)
	cp: copy a file
	rm: remove a file
	mkdir: make a directory
	rmdir: remove a directory
	ls: list contents of a directory
		-l: show long listing including permission info
		-a: list all files including hidden ones
		-s: show size of each file, in blocks
		-h: human readable form
		d: list only directories 

Redirection
	> file: write stdout to a file 
	>> file: append stdout to a file 
	< file: use contents of a file as stdin 


The Basics: File Name Matching
	• ?: matches any single character in a
	filename
	• *: matches one or more characters in a
	filename
	• []: matches any one of the characters
	between the brackets. Use ‘-’ to separate
	a range of consecutive characters.

The Basics: Common commands
	awk
	apropos: search the man page files in Unix and Unix-like operating systems
	od:  dump files in octal and other formats  
	cat
	cURL
	head
	tail
	grep
	sed
	du
	ps: List processes that are currently running
	wget
		A computer program that retrieves content from web servers 
		Usage 
		wget <URL> 
	kill
		Terminate a certain process
		Usage 
		kill PI
	diff
		A file comparison utility that outputs the differences between two files. 
		Shows the changes between one version of a file and a former version of the same file 
		Usage 
		diff original_file new_file
	cmp
	wc
	sort
	diff/patch
	Which
	cron
		Daemon – process that runs in the background
		Enables users to schedule jobs to run periodically at certain times (cron jobs)
		Example:
		Full Backup every month
	ln
	wh... commands
		whatis <command>: returns Name section of man page
		whereis <command>: locates the binary, source, and manual page files for a command

The Basics: Changing File Attributes
	• ln: create a link
	– Hard links: points to physical data
	– Soft links aka symbolic links (-s): points to a
	example
		Touch file_a
		Edit file_a
		Ln file_a file_b
		Ln –s file_a file_c
		View file_b file_c
		Rm file_a
		View file_b, file_c
		Edit file_a(different version)
	file
	• touch: update access & modification time
	to current time
		touch filename 
		touch -t 201101311759.30 filename 
		Change filename’s access & modification time to (year 2011 January day 31 time 17:59:30) 
	• chmod
		– read (r), write (w), executable (x)
		– User, group, others
		example
			Usage 
			– chmod [''references''][''operator''][''modes''] ''file1'' ... 
			Example: chmod ug+rw mydir, chmod a-w myfile, 
			Example: chmod ug=rx mydir, chmod 664 myfile 

The Basics: find
	• -type: type of a file (e.g,, directory,
	symbolic link)
	• -perm: permission of a file
	• -name: name of a file
	• -prune: don’t descend into a directory
	• -ls: list current file
	-maxdepth: how many levels to search
	examples
		Examples
		find . -name my* 
		find . -name my* -type f 
		find / -type f -name myfile
		find / -type d –name [xyz]
		find / -type d –name [x-z]

Regular Expressions
	regular expressions and metacharacters
	backrefernces for phone number problem from practice final

python
	focus on basis, as opposed to classes
		variables
		functions
		file I/O (with multiple languages)
		control structures
		classes
			self, where to put, when to use
	data type
		list(most freuently used?)
		string
		dictionary
		set, converting
